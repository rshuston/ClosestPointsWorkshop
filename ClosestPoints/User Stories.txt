As a ..., I want to ..., so that I can ...


As a nerd, I want to evaluate the closest-points solution using the four methods:
1) Permutation Search
2) Combination Search
3) Plane Sweep
4) Divide and Conquer,
so that I can compare the performance of the methods.

As a nerd, I want to measure the execution time of a closest-points solution method, so that I can assess its performance.


As a nerd, I want to generate test points for the closest-points solution using two methods:
1) Uniform random
2) Clustered random,
so that I can better exercise the behavior of the solution process.

As a nerd, I want to have the ability to set the number of points being evaluated by the closest-points algorithm, so that I have better control of the data set.

As a nerd, I want to be able to manually position the points being evaluated by the closest-points algorithm, so that I have better control of the data set.


As a nerd, I want to have control over the closest-point solution operations via the four strategies:
1) One Shot
2) Slow Animation
3) Fast Animation
4) Live
so that I have the ability to explore the solution operations.

As a nerd, I want to trace the execution paths of the closes-points solution, so that I can visually monitor the intermediate results of the solution process.

As a nerd, I want to have the ability to suspend and resume the execution of the closes-points solution, so that I can view an intermediate solution.

As a nerd, I want to have the ability to abort the execution of the closes-points solution, so that I can recover from inadvertently running "Slow Animation" for a large point set with an inefficient solution method.
