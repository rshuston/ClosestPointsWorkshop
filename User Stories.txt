As a ..., I want to ..., so that I can ...

As a nerd, I want to evaluate the closest-points solution using the four methods:
1) Naive Combination
2) Sorted Search
3) Plane Sweep
4) Divide and Conquer,
so that I can compare the performance of the methods.

As a nerd, I want to measure the execution time of a closest-points solution method, so that I can assess its performance.

As a nerd, I want to generate test points for the closest-points solution using two methods:
1) Uniform random
2) Clustered random,
so that I can better exercise the behavior of the solution process.

As a nerd, I want to be able to manually position the points being evaluated by the closest-points algorithm, so that I have better control of the data set.

As a nerd, I want to have the ability to set the number of points being evaluated by the closest-points algorithm, so that I have better control of the data set.

As a nerd, I want to have control over the closest-point solution operations via the four strategies:
1) Live
2) Fast Animation
3) Slow Animation
4) Single Step
so that I have the ability to both use and explore the solution operations.

As a nerd, I want to trace the execution paths of the closes-points solution, so that I can visually monitor the intermediate results of the solution process.
